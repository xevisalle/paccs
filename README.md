# Private, Anonymous, Collateralizable Commitments (PACCs) Proof-of-Concept

This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept of PACCs, a protocol meant to prevent MEV attacks on different kind of Blockchain scenarios such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). An academic paper describing the main idea behind this implementation can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12818).
